## About

### 📖 Description and Purpose

EZBuy is a modern, full-stack ecommerce platform designed for everyday shopping needs. The application provides a clean and intuitive interface for users to browse products, manage their shopping cart, and complete secure purchases. Built with a focus on simplicity and user experience, EZBuy streamlines the online shopping process while offering features like student discounts, order tracking, and personalized recommendations.

### 💡 Inspiration

Online shopping has become essential in our daily lives, yet many ecommerce platforms are cluttered with unnecessary features, slow performance, or complicated checkout processes. As students and frequent online shoppers, we noticed the frustration of navigating overly complex websites just to purchase everyday items. We wanted to create a streamlined shopping experience that prioritizes speed, clarity, and user satisfaction. EZBuy was born from our desire to build an ecommerce platform that focuses on what matters most: helping users find what they need quickly and complete their purchases effortlessly. With the addition of student discounts, we're also addressing the financial challenges faced by our peers in the student community.
