## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Got the orders saving to the database which was the main thing blocking us. The checkout flow works from start to finish now - add items to cart, go through Stripe, and the order shows up in history. The whole app feels complete and works the way we originally planned it.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Getting the cart and orders to connect properly to the backend took some debugging. Had to make sure the data was flowing correctly between React state and the PostgreSQL database. The Stripe integration had a learning curve but the documentation helped.

### 3. What were some of the highlights or achievements that you are most proud of in this project?

The student discount system works exactly how we wanted. Sign up with a .edu email and you get 30% off automatically, no coupon codes needed. The UI looks clean with the glassmorphism design. Getting real Stripe payments working was satisfying. Toast notifications make the app feel responsive and professional.

### 4. Reflecting on your web development journey so far, how have you grown since the beginning of the course?

Started the course barely knowing how to connect frontend to backend. Now we built a full e-commerce app with auth, payments, and database relationships. Understanding how data moves from React through API calls to PostgreSQL and back made everything make sense. Got better at debugging by actually reading errors instead of guessing.

### 5. Looking ahead, what are your goals related to web development, and what steps do you plan to take to achieve them?

Want to learn TypeScript since I wasted time on undefined errors. Need to learn testing because we had none and kept breaking stuff. Planning to try Next.js for better data fetching. Goal is to get an internship working on real production apps.
