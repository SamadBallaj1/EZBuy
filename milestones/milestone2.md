## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Creating the wireframes went smoother than expected. We were able to visualize the complete user flow from browsing products to checkout, which gave us a clear picture of what we need to build. The database design came together well once we mapped out all the relationships between users, products, carts, and orders. Having the student discount feature influenced how we structured several tables to support that functionality. The wireframes look professional and will make development easier.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Getting the wireframes to look polished and consistent across all four pages took more iterations than planned. We wanted a modern, clean design that looked like a real ecommerce site, not just basic sketches. Figuring out the database relationships was tricky at first, especially handling the cart items and order items as separate join tables. We also had to think through how to handle both guest checkout and registered user flows in our database schema.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We'll need guidance on implementing the Stripe payment integration. The student email verification feature (.edu validation) will also be new territory for us.
