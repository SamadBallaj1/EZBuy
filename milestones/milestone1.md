## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Planning went pretty smoothly overall. We all liked the ecommerce idea right away since online shopping is something we do constantly and understand well. Setting up the GitHub repo was straightforward, and dividing up the initial planning tasks worked out fine. Writing user stories was easier than expected because we could just think about our own experiences shopping online and what frustrates us about other sites.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We went back and forth a lot on how ambitious to make the feature list. The student discount feature seemed cool but we weren't sure if it would be too complex, so we spent time debating whether to make it a core feature or stretch goal. Also had some confusion initially about what counts as a custom feature versus a baseline feature for the rubric.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We've never integrated Stripe for payments before, so that's definitely going to need some guidance. Also not sure how complicated the authentication with Firebase or GitHub OAuth will be. The cart persistence thing might be tricky too - keeping track of items when users aren't logged in versus when they are. Basically we'll need help when we hit roadblocks with the new technologies and probably some debugging help when things inevitably break.
