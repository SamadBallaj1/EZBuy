## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

The pitch went really well and we got solid feedback on the student discount idea. Setting up the GitHub project board and creating all our issues was tedious but worth it, now everyone knows exactly what they're working on. We divided tasks by role (backend, frontend, full-stack) which makes it easier to work in parallel without stepping on each other's toes. Getting the organization permissions sorted out took a minute but now the whole team has proper access.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We had to work through repository permissions and organization settings to get everything configured properly. The planning phase took longer than expected, but it was worth it to have everything organized before diving into code.

### 3. Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We finished all the setup tasks. project board, issues, milestones, and the pitch. Next week we're hitting the database setup and React initialization first since everything else depends on those. Then we'll build out the APIs so frontend can start consuming them while full-stack handles integration.

### 4. Which features and user stories would you consider "at risk"? How will you change your plan if those items remain "at risk"?

Stripe setup is probably at risk since it's a new technology for us and can have unexpected setup quirks. If Stripe becomes a blocker, we'll implement a checkout confirmation flow first and add real payment processing once we have more time to troubleshoot. Student email verification is custom-built so that might need extra time, but it's core to our value proposition. If we fall behind schedule, we'd prioritize the main shopping flow and student discounts over stretch features like the admin dashboard and wishlist.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We might need support handling API URLs in dev vs production.
